# Keyboard-Wrist-Rests
A simple 3D modelling project to improve productivity

NAME
Keyboard Wrist Rests

DESCRIPTION

A simple pair of 3D printed rest custom fit for my keyboard. 

BACKGROUND

I decided to embark on this project as I found that the transition from using my laptop keyboard to using a seperate standing one to be somewhat off-putting. When compared to a laptop keyboard, my newer one has a significant height difference between where my wrists would lay and the actuation point of my fingers. I found that when typing for periods longer than 30 minutes, small aches would start to build up. 

As a result, I figured that I did not want to develop long term issues in my wrists and developed a few prototypes to combat this issue.

DESIGN METHODOLOGY

While I could have easily jumped right into a design, I decided to apply concepts that I had learned in my engineering program's design course. This meant coming up with several prototypes and iterations that provided their own unique benefits. 

Below are a few of my initial thoughts.

In the end I felt that Mk3. best represented what I wanted from the start; a close resemblance to the experience of typing on a laptop keyboard. With a sloped triangle design, the consistant angle proved to be great. This design would've also used less material since triangles are generally stronger.

To get a replicated angle, I used simple trigonometry and similar triangles to do so. I took the measurements of the length and height of the main keyboard and then compared this to the height of my rests in order to get the respective length. 

OBSTACLES

Even with such a simple design, I faced a few problems when finishing up this project. 

For one, I really did not like having a single long wrist rest. With the limited surface area, I found that changing the angle of my hand was not very feasible.
In response to this, I split the design into two. With seperate rests for either hand, I could now freely move my hand without inducing cramps over uncomfortable positions.

Later, I also found that having just a simple triangle shape would not cut it over time. When I laid my hands down, the hypotenuse part of the rest would gradually cave in and make typing difficult. As a simple fix, I found that adding a solid strip in the middle helped improve the structural integrity by quite a bit.

ATTACHED

I've attached the .stl and inventor files for anyone that wants to print it. The filemaps are for one rest, so you'd have to print it twice.
